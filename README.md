# Customer-Segmentation
This project explores the use of machine learning classification algorithms for customer segmentation in the context of a retail business. The aim is to group customers into different segments based on their buying behavior and preferences to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction. The project applies various classification algorithms, including K-means clustering, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors to classify the customers into different segments based on their work experience, Spending Score, demographic information etc. In our work, Random Forest was found to give the best performance across various metrics. The findings of this project have practical implications for retailers seeking to improve their marketing strategies and customer engagement through personalized approaches.
